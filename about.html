				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>
					<b>Educational Background</b>
					I am currently studying Digital Business and Innovation in Tokyo International University.
                    This website is made as part of my Introduction to Informatics and Computing Course.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Ethnic Background</b> 
					I am from the Philippines, a country in Southeast Asia. 
					To be more specific, I am from Benguet, Cordillera. 
					It is full of mountain ranges hencewhy they call us "Igorots" menaing "People of the Mountain"
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>What brought me to Japan?</b> 
					I am currently in Japan to study. 
					I never thought of studying abroad which is why I am extremely grateful to be able to do so through a scholarship.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>How is life in Japan so far?</b> 
					It's been a year but honestly I am still adjusting to life here.
					Compared to where I'm from, Japan is a pretty much like a beehive with a lot of bustling bees.
					There are indeed endless opportunities but people need to be careful before those 'opportunities' end them first.
					Hence, I really suggest taking a breather once in a while, go to a body of water and have some bread.
					You'll realise being a duck is quite enjoyable.
